Super Lemonade Factory.

How to use this level editor project.

Download the Ogmo Editor from http://www.ogmoeditor.com/
You'll need to download the Ogmo Editor version 0.918. This project may not work with Ogmo Editor v2.x.
The Ogmo Editor is a free and open source level editor created by Matt Thorson. It will run on Windows, Linux and OSX.

The Ogmo Editor requires Adobe Air. If you don't have Adobe Air installed, download it from Adobe's website. 

Once installed, open it up and go to File > Open Project.
Open the file _SuperLemonadeFactory.oep

From here you can open existing levels or create your own.



If you have created a level you'd like to see in the game, email you .oel file to initials@initialscommand.com. Unfortunately, I do not yet have a way to upload or insert level files directly into the game.
